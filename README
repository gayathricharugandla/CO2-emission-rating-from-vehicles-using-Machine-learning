This study leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict CO2 emissions based on various parameters, including vehicle type, engine specifications, fuel consumption, driving conditions, and historical 
emissions data. This research contributes to the ongoing efforts to mitigate climate change by promoting the development of cleaner, more efficient vehicles. 

Libraries:
• Torch
• Flask
• Numpy
• Keras

The proposed system aims to develop a predictive model for vehicle CO2 emissions using machine learning, and deploy it as a Flask web application. The project involves collecting and preprocessing vehicle data,
training and evaluating machine learning models, and creating an API with Flask to serve predictions.
Machine learning algorithm used is multiple linear regression. Multiple linear regression refers to a statistical technique that uses two or more independent variables to predict the outcome of a dependent variable.
The technique enables analysts to determine the variation of the model and the relative contribution of each independent variable in the total variance.
